# Formal Methods

Formal methods are logical techniques for specifying and verifying the correctness of algorithms, systems, protocols, hardware, etc.

Generally speaking, when we design an data structure, system, protocol, new hardware, etc we have an idea of what it is supposed to do and what properties we are supposed to have. Formal methods are the way that we demonstrate that we have the properties we want and that our design is doing what it is supposed to do.

In this repository I am going to review Floyd-Hoare Logic, Seperation Logic, and Temporal Logic of Actions. Then I am going to add some specifications of different things that I find interesting.

The [Logical Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html) book is a good place to start if you are interested in formal methods. All of the [Software Foundations books](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu) in fact are great for learning formal methods.
